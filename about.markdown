I am a Principal Software Engineer working for [FIS](https://www.fisglobal.com/). I specialize in Java and the Spring Framework+Ecosystem.
I've worked in telecom, tele-health, payments, and market research. I grew up in and currently live with my girlfriend and corgi
in Highlands Ranch, CO.

I have a lot of tips/tricks/opinions in the space of back-end Java, so I started this blog for a place to publish and
refer to them.
